# Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with TensorFlow

My course work for [Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse) with references to original material and my personalized notes and content.

The notebooks offered in the original repo has been modified to reflect my learningas well as accomodating for my local enfironment. I am running the content on Google Colab powered by my local Jupyter Notebook server. Also, I am running on Apple M1 Pro Macbook Pro 2021 with TensorFlow version `2.8.0`
